%% Q1 and Q2
% Required data was downloded. Code was studied to understand NMF implementation. 

%% Q3

%%
% We can notice that MSE in training image is low compared to that of
% test image and myImg. Training image belong to the same space for which
% Components (Non negative activations) were extracted. Therefor error is
% less and reconstruction is better. Test
% image do not belong the same space, but it still contain faces with
% similar backgrounds, lightening conditions etc. Hence it still be 
% explained with basis vectors of NMF of training data upto some extenct.
% The error is found to be
% greater that train image but lesser than myImg, which is expected. We
% can also compare reconstructed faces. Reconstruction is worse than
% training image but better than myImg.
% MyImg neither belongs training space, nor does to a similar space. The
% background, lightening conditions etc are drastically different. Hence
% the error is very large and reconstruction is worst amongst all. In fact
% we can't even notice a face in it. 

%% Q4
% Only 25 basis
nmf2_kalpesh 
%% 
% The error while training in each iteration is greater than before.
% Currently we are using less numbe of basis, hence the error is more. Also
% we need more number of iterations to reach the same training errror. 
% In reconstruction the error pattern is still the same (train < test < myImg).
% There hasn't been much increase observed in MSE when lesser number of basis vetors
% are used. Rather MSE is improved for myImg. This observation is different
% than PCA


%% Q5. Comparison of PCA and NMF

%% 
% I used the same images from train and test dataset which were used
% earlier in PCA assignment. (PCA images not included in this report as they
% were already included in the report of PCA assignment)
% After comparing PCA and NMF it is oserved that PCA performs a lot better
% in terms of reconstruction. The reconstructed faces in case of PCA are
% better than that of NMF for train images. We can compare NMF and PCA as
% follows

%% 
%
% # Eigenfaces in PCA are difficult to interprete, while the basis vectors
% in NMF are easier to interprete and can be associated to different
% structures found in the image
% # There doesn't exist any nonnegative constraint in PCA
% # NMF is that it usually produces a sparse representation
% of the data, which is observed in activation vectors of images listed
% above. 
% # Overall performance for reconstruction is better in case of PCA than
% NMF. But NMF has performed better for myImg, which implies PCA fails if
% input not belonging to the subspace is given, while NMF performs better
% in that case. But for images belonging to the give space (or similar
% space) PCA is better than NMF.
